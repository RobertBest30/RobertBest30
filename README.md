Hello! I'm Robert Best, and l'm passionate about technology, football, and marvel comics. As a computer science graduate, I enjoy learning about new developments in AI, Machine Learning, and anything to do with the technology industry. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
In my free time, I love watching the Pittsburgh Steelers reading Marvel Comics and watching any show/movie that has to deal with Marvel. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers to solve interesting problems.
Feel free to check out my repositories and projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
